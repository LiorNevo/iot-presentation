SoC (Raspberry Pi, Arduino), Sensors, Switches <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

Note: 
We have the basic stuff, like personal computers, laptops and phones. We even have cars, refrigerators, and coffee machines.

Then we have the little stuff, which are system on a chip and single board computers like the raspberry pi, arduino which is essentially 
a micro-controller. A micro controller does not have an operating system, and has little memory to store a small program to run. We also have sensors, switches etc.
